      ## What is the price?


      Price is very good ✨.


      ### Scope


      * Run this project locally using local content within this repository.

      * Connect to Tina Cloud to benefit from its GraphQL Content API.

      * Deploy the site to visually edit your site.

      * Invite collaborators.


      ## Requirements


      * Git

      * [Node.js Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)

      * Yarn


      ## Fork this repository


      ⚠️⚠️ Start by **forking** the repository and then pull it down to your
      computer. ⚠️⚠️


      ## Install


      > ℹ️ This project uses `yarn` as a package manager, if `yarn` isn't
      installed on your machine, open a terminal and run `npm install -g yarn`


      Install the project's dependencies:


      ```

      yarn install

      ```


      > ⚠️ If you'd like to use `npm` beware that there is no
      `package-lock.json` so we can't guarantee the dependencies are the same
      for you.


      ## Run the project locally


      To run the local development server:


      ```

      yarn dev

      ```


      This command starts the GraphQL server and the Next.js application in
      development mode. It also regenerates your schema types for TypeScript and
      GraphQL so changes to your `.tina` config are reflected immediately.


      One of the most interesting aspects of the Tina Cloud Content API is that
      it doesn't actually require anything from the Cloud to work locally. Since
      Tina is by default a Git-backed CMS, everything can be run from your local
      filesystem via the CLI. \:sunglasses:


      This is ideal for development workflows and the API is identical to the
      one used in the cloud, so once you're ready to deploy your application you
      won't face any challenges there.


      Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to
      see your file-based content being loaded from the GraphQL API.
