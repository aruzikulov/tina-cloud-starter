      ## What is the price?


      We donâ€™t ask for any payment upfront when we offer our sourcing service.
      You only pay us when you are happy with everything we do for you, from
      finding products, getting quotes, tracking orders, checking quality, to
      arranging shipping. Our goal is to help you get high quality products at
      the best possible price with a fully transparent process.

      The fees below are what we charge for coordinating with suppliers and
      helping you with product sourcing, factory audits, order follow-ups,
      quality inspections and shipping support. We make it easier for you to
      import products from China.
